# ncltPredictor

train.py:  to train a baseline (RNN)

train2.py: add velocity constraints (make sure all x and y linear not greater than the maximum in the training set)

normal.py: to plot the trajectory for training and val dataset ( the test set doesn't overlap with the training one, so I choose the val as the test set)
